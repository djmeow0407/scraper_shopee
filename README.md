### Notes & Recommendations

* **Login Required for Full Results:**
  Shopee restricts the number of visible products for non-logged-in users.
  To scrape more than ~40 products, **you must log in to Shopee in the opened browser window** before continuing.

* **Captcha Handling:**
  If a captcha page appears, **you must solve it immediately** in the browser window.
  The scraper will automatically continue once the captcha is cleared.

* **Delays:**
  The tool includes randomized delays to reduce the risk of being rate-limited or blocked.

* **Periodic Save:**
  Data is saved every 5 products and again upon completion to prevent loss.

* **Resume Support:**
  If scraping is interrupted, re-run the same command ‚Äî previously saved products will be skipped.
